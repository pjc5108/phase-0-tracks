# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is the management of things like documents and code. It is useful because functional code can be maintained while additional features are being created and tested. It also allows multiple users to work on code simultaneously.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of a file or files. One would be used when creating and testing a new feature leaving the master file intact and functioning.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a kind of save point for a repository. A good commit message concisely describes changes that were made to files.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when multiple changes within the same lines of code occur, and it is not immediately determinable which changes take precedence.
